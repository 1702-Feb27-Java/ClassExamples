PART II - FizzBuzz
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a javescript function that calculates FizzBuzz.
-The function should traverse a field of numbers, printing each one out.
-If the number to be printed is a multiple of 3, then it prints fizz
-If the number to be printed is a multiple of 5, then it prints buzz
-If the number is, both, a multiple of 3 and 5, it prints fizzbuzz
-For example:
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz

-In addition to this, you will have to create an html file that invokes this function.
-The html document should have fields for minimum and maximum values to be printed.
-There should be a button to run fizzbuzz that also passes in the parameters.
-There should be validation for both fields, the min can NOT go below 1.
-The max should not be allowed to go above 200.
-When the function runs, it will print the results on the same page that called it.
