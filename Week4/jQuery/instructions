add the following use cases to the example
if there are 0 items in the task list display a message to reflect that
    "You have 0 tasks for the day"
	
add a check box to indicate whether the task is complete or not
    You can change the styling to reflect this change
	
add a priority system to the mix
    new items are automatically given the lowest priority
    completed items don't get a priority
    the list should always display highest to lowest priority
