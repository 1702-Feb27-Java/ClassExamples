	<!-- This page will show servlet interactions. It will also show how to interact with a simple
		FrontEndController design. All servlet urls that are labeled in the "action" attributes of
		the forms end in .do
		
		So we can create a filter that intercepts all url patterns that end in .do and react to them
		accordingly.  -->

	<h1>Servlet Example</h1>
	<hr>
	<!-- Here we create a form that will direct the submission to the servlet url: ExampleServlet.do.
		This will pass the information in the httpRequest body since we are using POST as the method.
		The information passed will be key/value pairs with "name" being the key and "value" being the value. -->
	<form action="ExampleServlet2.do" method="POST">
		Username
		<input type="text" name="uname"><br>
		Password
		<input type="password" name="pwd"><br>
		Radio Buttons<br>
		<input type="radio" name="myRadio" value="button1">button1 <!-- Note, for radio buttons, they must be named the same for them to be part of the same group. -->
		<input type="radio" name="myRadio" value="button2">button2

	<hr> <!-- This form will submit a form to the "SessionHandler.do" url.
			This will be sent as a GET since if you don't specify a "method" it will
			default to GET.
			You can use hidden type inputs to pass hidden values with a submission.
			This is a way to perform session handling, though not a particularily powerful way  -->

	file list in my web.xml, that makes index.html the launch page for my application. -->
